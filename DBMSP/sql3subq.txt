A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query and
embedded within clauses, most commonly in the WHERE clause.
Subqueries can be used with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements
along with the operators like =, <, >, >=, <=, IN, BETWEEN, etc.
Subqueries with the SELECT Statement
Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records âˆ’
SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM
CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY > 4500) ;
Result:
Subqueries with the INSERT Statement
INSERT INTO table_name [ (column1 [, column2 ]) ]
SELECT [ *|column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[ WHERE VALUE OPERATOR ]
Example:
SQL> INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS_BKP
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID
FROM CUSTOMERS) ;
Subqueries with the UPDATE Statement
UPDATE table
SET column_name = new_value
[ WHERE OPERATOR [ VALUE ]
(SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM TABLE_NAME)
[ WHERE) ]
Example:
SQL> UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET SALARY = SALARY * 0.25 WHERE AGE IN (SELECT AGE
FROM CUSTOMERS_BKP WHERE AGE >= 27 );
