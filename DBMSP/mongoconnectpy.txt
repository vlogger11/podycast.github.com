# For a remote server, replace the URL with your server's information

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_url)

# Access the database (create it if it doesn't exist)
db = client[database_name]

# You are now connected to the MongoDB database, and you can perform operations on it.

# To access a specific collection within the database, you can do:
collection_name = "your_collection_name"
collection = db[collection_name]

# Now you can perform CRUD operations on the collection.
# For example, to insert a document into the collection:
data = {"key": "value"}
collection.insert_one(data)

# Remember to close the connection when you're done with it.
client.close()
